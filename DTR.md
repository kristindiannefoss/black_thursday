##DTR Memo
##Project: Black Thursday
*Group Member Names: Sal Espinosa, Kris Foss

*What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?
  Sal: To work with a system that is similar to active record, get prepared for what's coming in the next module, work with CSVs and external data.
  Kris: Similar goals, to have an example project that worked with e-commerce data for portfolio and future career prospects.

*When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?
  Sal: Open, Moved to Denver for this so he's in it to win it.
  Kris: Open, prefers not to have to work before class.  Needs to leave by around 8:30pm most nights, can screen hero after that after commute.

*How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?
  If we're here, in person communication, both available on slack, screen hero.

*What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?
  Sal: Strengths are making things work, get the base expectations and an extension.  Would like to work on variable naming, breaking down the problem into logical components, refactoring, making the code look better.  

  Kris: Has done some work on naming conventions, wants to work on improving syntax, which enumerables to use when, class organization, breaking into single responsibility.  

*Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?
  TBD

*What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?
  Let's review together before merging.  Can work on our own branches when apart, review together.  Waffle, for project management.  Commiting often.  New branch when starting a new iteration or idea.  

*What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?
  If we get to a point when we're splitting things up, maybe make a good effort to figure it out but reach out when needed.

*How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?
  Sal: Just wants to be told
  Kris: General kindness when giving feedback would be super.  I do want to hear the feedback.  

*Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?
  Sal: Wants to make sure indecision is met with decisiveness.  
  Kris: Prefer not to work early mornings.  Tend to be indecisive as well, lets make big kid decisions.  

*Additional Notes:
  Aim to get 4's, except for functional expectations.  Wants to focus on writing good code, then go back if there is time to do more.
  Refactoring as you go along
